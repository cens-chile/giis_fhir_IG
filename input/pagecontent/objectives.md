Objectives of this project 

### Objectives 

Implement a HL7 FHIR Facade that can make the interoperability possible in GIIS. This facade will have a security based procotol that is explained on the [SMART Security](smart.html) page, and will handle patient, immunization and ESAVI related. Among the information to be structured are elements related to vaccine stock and cold chain, which, although it is possible to structure HL7 FHIR resources, their scope is limited to the complexity of the requirements of the previously mentioned elements.
