This example has been temporary added to this Implementation Guide and makes reference to <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/PanAmericanHealthOrganization/OPS-ESAVI/Questionnaire-CuestionarioESAVI.html">this example</a>, to allow the pre-adoption of some changes not yet officially published.<br/>
This example <b>is not</b> an official OPS profile and it will be removed as soon as the next official release will be published.<br/>
This example was modified with the minimal set of data required in the case of the GIIS, also the explicative text was translated from the referenced IG to this one.
