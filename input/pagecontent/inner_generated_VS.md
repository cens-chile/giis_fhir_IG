## Value Sets

In this guide you can see some value sets that are based on **example** Code System. As said, this are here just as examples, **inside the facade** there will be certain operations that will generate each required Value Set from each required table to generate them. 

The tables used to generate those Value Set and expose them will be the ones related to the body site of vaccination, the vaccination campaign, the ones related to aefi, the health facilities and villages, the ones that have both the reasons and not vaccination reasons, and finally the tables containing the vaccines.

> **There are two tables related to vaccines and, inside the facade, there will be two generation of them because there is a table one table manages the internal stock of vaccines at specific health facilities, while the other handles those not associated with the internal stock**
