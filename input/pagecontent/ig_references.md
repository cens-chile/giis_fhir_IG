### ESAVI IG

The ESAVI related profiles (QuestionnaireResponse and the answered questionnaires) are based on the [ESAVI IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/PanAmericanHealthOrganization/OPS-ESAVI/index.html). 
Said IG is still in build version, however, it helped solving some of the ESAVI related requirements, adjusting the questionnaire with the minimal set of data required in the case of the GIIS.
