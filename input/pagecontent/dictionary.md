### Data dictionary 

The data dictionary helps to understand the mapping of the profiles in this guide. This is made, in our case, by a data set mapping method using a Google Spreadsheet. You can find the spreadsheet [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pbm50B8rqJOl1nNs7D_xBQYhQwzaC490f6sPJQThQ2k/edit#gid=0) to see every single data related to this whole process and how it is converted to a FHIR Path. 
> The spreadsheet should have changes if the IG Profiles happens to have them too, in order to keep it updated.
