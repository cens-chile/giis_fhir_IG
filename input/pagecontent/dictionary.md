### Data dictionary 

The data dictionary helps to understand which tables are being referenced in the new FHIR profiles. This is made, in our case, by a data set mapping method using a Google Spreadsheet. You can find the spreadsheet [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JpkDUIGzynTZHHz_0yGhVUvGgbAetctgjEpz5fhS40I/edit#gid=0) to see every single data related to this whole process and how it is converted to FHIR. 
> This spreadsheet can have changes, if it happens to have them, you HAVE to also change the data from the profiles related to those changes(if needed).
